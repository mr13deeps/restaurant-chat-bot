**ChatBot**

Chatbots are programs that simulate normal human-like conversations via text messages or chat. It may depend on the actual use, but their main task is to provide converser with the answers to questions that they might have. There are several chatbots based on the industry or domain in which it is used. 

1.Customer service chatbot

2.E-commerce chatbots

3.Virtual assistant chatbots

**About the project:**

I have built a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deeplearning frameworks like tensorflow. This is a restaurant chatbot which answers questions related to a typical restaurant like working hours, items available and several others. We can make it even more comparable to real life situations by including more questions and responses to the dataset.
